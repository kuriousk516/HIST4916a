Museums, often considered bastions of knowledge, learning, and public good have fallen under an increasingly critical gaze -- and rightfully so. Public museums have been tools of colonialism, racism, and superiority centred around the supremacy of the west and its history. \n",

The appendix' list is a small fraction of the stolen artifacts found in hundreds of museums all over the world but it is a powerful point of focus. I want to create something, however small, that can give others the tools to scrape data from other museum websites and interrogate why *they* are the institutions holding these artifacts, what effect that has, what's being done with them, and what \"ownership\" is. Can anyone own art? Who has the power to decide? How do we give that power back to those who were stolen from? \n",
