    "> I'm following the template and trying to build up some of my skills, but I definitely struggle with wanting something to be 'perfect' immediately before I even really get started. I want to have the ideal image in mind of what the output should be. But, I know that's not actually feasible or realistic. So this is me figuring things out and hopefully making something interesting along the way. Let's see what I end up creating! :smile: \n",

    "I'm sticking with the Benin bronzes that are still in Canadian museums and centre it around the discussion prompted by Dan Hicks and Dr. Kisha Supernant on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArchaeoMapper/status/1375447277959929869). \n",

I know that's not the point of this class - it's not to punish us or make us feel like we're lacking and not doing enough, but I still feel an overwhelming sense of panic about the whole thing; it's so difficult to think rationally. \n",
