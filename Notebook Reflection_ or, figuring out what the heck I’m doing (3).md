# Notebook Reflection: or, figuring out what the heck I'm doing

###### tags: `digital humanities, museums, reflections`

> I'm following the template and trying to build up some of my skills, but I definitely struggle with wanting something to be 'perfect' immediately before I even really get started. I want to have the ideal image in mind of what the output should be. But, I know that's not actually feasible or realistic. So this is me figuring things out and hopefully making something interesting along the way. Let's see what I end up creating! :smile:

> Without further ado, here's the saga of my process of creating the final notebook. 

## Where do I start?
This amount of work should really not be a whole lot. Like, I've done *way* more in a semester and managed alright and got good grades. But this is also a pandemic and my health continues to be a hot mess. 

So, how should I tackle what *feels* like an insurmountable task? 

### Backtracking

- [ ] Go over the previous weeks' assigned work. 
- [ ] Examine data examples from Ottawa. 
- [ ] Decide on my definition of **'meaningful'**.
- [ ] Wrangling some data?
- [ ] Doing some ~visualisation.

What questions are they setting out to do with the data?
>1. What types and weights of munitions were dropped during World War II (WWII)? What patterns can we discern in the use of different types of munitions?
>2. How did the types and weights of munitions dropped change over the course of WWII? How do these changes correspond to major military events?
>3. What targets were munitions dropped on during the war? Were particular types of munitions limited to certain theaters of operations or targets?

I'm really interested in creating something that can be uesd by others, even if it isn't *directly* related to GLAM in Ottawa. (Well, the tweet says that the Museum of History has some, so I guess it *is* related?)

Creating a database around where someone can easily see where Benin bronzes are being held in Canada, and what that means for our colonial history and repatriation, seems like a worthwhile project to me. 

Then comes the fun part of learning how to scrape info from websites and the internet. Oh, fun!

### Working through tutorials

Since I found it a bit tricky to have 12+ web pages open at once, going back and forth to figure out how to work the different tutorials and keep track of everything, I thought YouTube might be an easier place to start and have a sort of base-knowledge before going into the tutorials on the course website.

Here is the process of web-scraping from Data Professor, a YouTuber who has free tutorials on how to use python, pandas, etc. Links to his Github repository is below.

Data Professor (Chanin Nantasenamat, Ph.D., and Associate Professor of Bioinformatics and YouTuber) has a useful tutorial on how to do web-scraping and then turn the data into infographics. I'm gonna list out the process here just for my own information to refer back to: 

1. Go to his[ Github](https://github.com/dataprofessor/) code repositories
    a. click on "pandas_read_html_for_webscraping.ipynb"

2. In his example, he's dealing with NBA player stats. It's not related to history or museums, but dealing with a smaller data set seems to be working with my brain a bit better.

==3. He then right-clicks on the "raw" tab and instructs the user to click "save link as" and then have a copy of the file on your computer.==

#### Wget

This is the link to week 9 on the course website, where it details how to scrape info on the net using wget. So I guess now it's a matter of figuring out which one is easiest to deal with. 

This is all taken from the [DH4916a website](https://craftingdh.netlify.app/week/2/wget/) and prompted from Dr. Graham's discord advice. (Screenshots below.)

This has been so much fun!

JK. I feel like I'm stuck in a tech nightmare. 

I'm not usually bad at dealing with technology; I like to think that I can deal with most things intuitively, or at least look up what I don't know, but it feels like I walked into an exam where I studied for one subject, thought I had a grasp on it, and then it turns out I studied for the wrong thing and I failed. I know that's not the point of this class - it's not to punish us or make us feel like we're lacking and not doing enough, but I still feel an overwhelming sense of panic about the whole thing; it's so difficult to think rationally. 

==Already, the YouTube tutorial feels much easier and less overwhelming to follow.==

### Making mistakes. Whooooo.

## WTH is this notebook gonna be about?
I'm sticking with the Benin bronzes that are still in Canadian museums and centre it around the discussion prompted by Dan Hicks and Dr. Kisha Supernant on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArchaeoMapper/status/1375447277959929869). 
## What should all of this mean?
